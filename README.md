# Some Forestry Code
I have uploaded some .js files and some html files. 

The html files are split by filename. those that have 'edited' within the title have been edited by myself. by comparing the 2 groups of html files you will be able to see that the edited versions are responsive. These responsive files were written thusly because they are prt of a campaign that uses Silverpop

The .js files re files that i have worked on. 

I utilised jquery for 
- Accessibility and usability aspect
- iNaturalist Map manipulation
- Slider manipulation

The .js files were not composed by myself but rather the design company that spearheaded the design of the new forestry site
